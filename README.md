Gem Game is a multiplayer browser game implemented in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) using the [MacroQuad](https://github.com/not-fl3/macroquad) library. Gameplay draws heavy inspiration from [The Underground](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/The_Underground) area seen in the Generation IV Pokemon games. The game's visual aesthetic is inspired by said Pokemon games as well as [Familars.io](https://www.familiars.io/).
